Think of it like teaching AI to draw by first learning how images get blurry and then learning to make them clear again.\n","\n","### What We'll Build\n","- A diffusion model capable of generating realistic images\n","- For most students: An AI that generates handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset\n","- For students with more computational resources: Options to work with more complex datasets\n","- Visual demonstrations of how random noise gradually transforms into clear, recognizable images\n","- By the end, your AI should create images realistic enough for another AI to recognize them\n","\n","### Dataset Options\n","This lab offers flexibility based on your available computational resources:\n","\n","- Standard Option (Free Colab): We'll primarily use the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, which works well with limited GPU memory and completes training in a reasonable time frame. Most examples and code in this notebook are optimized for MNIST.\n","\n","- Advanced Option: If you have access to more powerful GPUs (either through Colab Pro/Pro+ or your own hardware), you can experiment with more complex datasets like Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, or even face generation. You'll need to adapt the model architecture, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics accordingly.\n","\n","### Resource Requirements\n","- Basic MNIST: Works with free Colab GPUs (2-4GB VRAM), ~30 minutes training\n","- Fashion-MNIST: Similar requirements to MNIST\n","CIFAR-10: Requires more memory (8-12GB VRAM) and longer training (~2 hours)\n","- Higher resolution images: Requires substantial GPU resources and several hours of training\n","\n","### Before You Start\n","1. Make sure you're running this in Google Colab or another environment with GPU access\n","2. Go to 'Runtime' → 'Change runtime type' and select 'GPU' as your hardware accelerator\n","3. Each code cell has comments explaining what it does\n","4. Don't worry if you don't understand every detail - focus on the big picture!\n","5. If working with larger datasets, monitor your GPU memory usage carefully\n","\n","The concepts you learn with MNIST will scale to more complex datasets, so even if you're using the basic option, you'll gain valuable knowledge about generative AI that applies to more advanced applications.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sAD_17ST9_xE"},"source":["## Step 1: Setting Up Our Tools\n","First, let's install and import all the tools we need.

Understanding Diffusion\n","- Explain what happens during the forward diffusion process, using your own words and referencing the visualization examples from your notebook.\n","\n","- Why do we add noise gradually instead of all at once? How does this affect the learning process?\n","\n","- Look at the step-by-step visualization - at what point (approximately what percentage through the denoising process) can you first recognize the image? Does this vary by image?\n","\n","### 2. Model Architecture\n","- Why is the U-Net architecture particularly well-suited for diffusion models? What advantages does it provide over simpler architectures?\n","\n","- What are skip connections and why are they important? Explain them in relations to our model\n","\n","- Describe in detail how our model is conditioned to generate specific images. How does the class conditioning mechanism work?\n","\n","### 3. Training Analysis (20 points)\n","- What does the loss value tell of your model tell us?\n","\n","- How did the quality of  your  generated images change change throughout the training process?\n","\n","- Why do we need the time embedding in diffusion models? How does it help the model understand where it is in the denoising process?\n","\n","### 4. CLIP Evaluation (20 points)\n","- What do the CLIP scores tell you about your generated images? Which  images got  the highest and lowest quality scores?\n","\n","- Develop a hypothesis explaining why certain images might be easier or harder for the model to generate convincingly.\n","\n","- How could CLIP scores be used to improve the diffusion model's generation process? Propose a specific technique.\n","\n","### 5.

CLIP-Guided Selection: Generate 10 samples of each image, use CLIP to evaluate them, and select the top 3 highest-quality examples of each.
